title:  "New Org - `rsssf` -  RSSSF (Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation) Archive Data Imports for `football.db`"
---

Added a new GitHub org, that is, [`rsssf`](https://github.com/rsssf) - hosting
RSSSF archive data that you can read into your SQL database of choice (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).
Still early and a little rough - as always expect surprises. 

What's the [RSSSF (Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation)](http://www.rsssf.com)?

The RSSSF collects and offers football league tables from all over the world in plain text. Example: 

~~~
Round 1
[May 25]
Vasco da Gama   1-0 Portuguesa
 [Carlos Tenório 47']
Vitória         2-2 Internacional
 [Maxi Biancucchi 2', Gabriel Paulista 11'; Diego Forlán 29', Fred 63']
Corinthians     1-1 Botafogo
 [Paulinho 73'; Rafael Marques 24']
...
