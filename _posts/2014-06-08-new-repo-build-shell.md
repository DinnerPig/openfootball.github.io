title:  "New Repo - `/build-shell` - for Building your own `football.db` Copy using Shell Scripts"
---

Added new repo, that is, [`/build-shell`](https://github.com/openfootball/build-shell) for
building your own up-to-date `football.db` copy from the latest datasets using shell scripts.
Thanks to Joe Kampschmidt to get it all started and the write-up and the shell script.
