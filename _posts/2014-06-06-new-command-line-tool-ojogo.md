title:  "New Command Line Tool - `ojogo` gem - Who's Playing Today?"
---


Added new command line tool, that is, [`ojogo`](https://github.com/sportdb/ojogo.ruby)
that prints today's matches for the World Cup 2014 in Brazil
using the football.db HTTP JSON API service. For example, typing on Jun/29 

~~~
$ ojogo    # defaults to today's world cup 2014 matches 
~~~

will print 

~~~
Netherlands (NED) vs Mexico (MEX) 
Costa Rica (CRC) vs Greece (GRE) 
~~~
