title:  "New Tool - `sportweb` - Instant Open Sports Web Browser (Server) e.g. Use `$ sportweb`"
---

Bundled up the `sport.db.admin` web app into an easy-to-use command line tool
for (local) use on your own machine. How does it work? 

Let's say you have an SQLite database - e.g. `football.db` - in your folder, than just type 

~~~
$ sportweb 
~~~

and that's it - open your browser (e.g. use `localhost:3000`) and 
start browsing your local SQLite database. 

How to install the machinery? 

It's a [Ruby gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/sportweb) [(Source)](https://github.com/sportdb/sport.db.web.ruby ), thus, type: 

~~~
$ gem install sportweb 
~~~

That's it.
