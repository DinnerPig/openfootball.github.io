title:  "New Org - `football.csv` - Football Match Data in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) Format e.g. `Arsenal, Liverpool, 2-0, 1-0`"
---


Added a new GitHub org, that is, [`football.csv`](https://github.com/footballcsv),
that collects football match data in the CSV (comma-separated  values) format for easy (re)use and started adding all seasons for the English Premier League, the Football League (Championship, League One, League Two), etc.
to the new [`/en-england`](https://github.com/footballcsv/en-england) repo.
