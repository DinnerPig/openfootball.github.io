title:  "New Repo - `/docs` - for Documentation (Articles, Tips & Tricks, Notes, Examples, etc.)"
---


Added a new repo, that is, [`/docs`](https://github.com/openfootball/docs) - to collect 
all the documentation in one place and make it easier to contribute.
Still in an early stage the first pages include:

- Intro - football.db - What? Why? 
- SQL Queries Examples 
- HTTP JSON API Intro 

Thanks again to Joe Kampschmidt for the first docu contribution,
that is, notes on a couple of SQL query examples for the world cup.
