title:  "sportdb Update v1.9.4 - Adds `clubs.txt`, Week 1 Round Headers, `en/2013-14/pl.txt`, etc."
---


What's news? sportdb command line tool updates:

- Added `clubs.txt` as an alternative for `teams.txt` (recommended for football clubs
    otherwise clubs might get flagged as national teams and not as clubs). 
- Added `2013-14` as an alternative for `2013_14` in your 
    fixture path (e.g. `2013-14/1-premierleague-i.txt` now works).
- Added Week 1 or Week 5 and so on in your match schedule (in 
    English/en) for matchday/round headers.
